                            My name is Amrit Singh and welcome to my portfolio.<br><br>
                            I am currently undertaking a four year BSc course in Computer Science. 
                            I have always enjoyed computer science, and hence I am now pursuing a degree in it.
                            What I find even more exciting is that the reason that my course is four years long is because
                            in the third year, I have the oportunity to go study abroad. I am a young, smart and confident 
                            individual with a lot of skills under my belt and always ready to add more.
                            I am very hard working and I am always ready to try my best.

                        <p>
                            It is very exciting that I have the opportunity to go abroad for a year and study at another amazing university.
                            Personally, I would absolutely love it if I get in to Seoul National University for the year
                            (There is a lot of competition for these spots). The reason I would like to go to South Korea is simple actually...<br><br>
                            I am really into their music, shows and food. Going there for a year would be a perfect opportunity to
                            experience their culture first hand and dive deeper into their culture. I am also currently trying to 
                            learn Korean all on my own and I am slowly improving day by day. <br><br>
                            Furthermore, this is a fantastic opportunity to make me more independent, push me out of my comfort
                            zone, try new things and meet new people.

                    <article id="Past-Exp" class="Body-Div">
                        <p class="Main-Text">
                            Computer science is a diverse industry to dive into. At a young age, 
                            I started making really long and complex animations in Scratch. 
                            I would always try to go above and beyond in what I am doing; 
                            whether it is by making a really long and complex animation in the 
                            software or attempting to make a game. These interests then lead me 
                            to apply for an online python course. This then sparked a passion for 
                            this subject that I never foresaw. By the time it came around to do my 
                            GCSE's, I was quite experienced at the subject and the programming side 
                            of the course was just another excuse for me to program. This passion for 
                            the subject drove me to do external courses outside of school. I applied for
                            online courses in android studio using java and ethical hacking. 
                            I was really into app development and I ended up making a basic social 
                            networking app in my free time. This was a long and challenging task for
                            me as building such an app is definitely not a one man job in the real
                            world.However, in the end, the satisfaction of creeating one is really worth it.

                                            I started to learn how to program in java in 2016. I started with an online course on a stite
                                            called Udemy. It was an Android Development course using Android Studio. This was my first exposure to 
                                            Java and I had made a lot of simple apps from currency converters to a fairly basic social networking app.
                                            <br>
                                            My next exposure was at university where it was taught in great detail and a lot of my missunderstandings 
                                            were cleared. I enjoyed the module so much that I had completed the course work in the second week and did fairly 
                                            well in the end of modual exam. For the second semester, we still went over java but it was focused 
                                            on the object orientated part of java. For the project I made a simple Mario-like game.

                                        I had immersed myself into computer science at a very young age. My dad is a programmer and when the 
                                        Rassbery Pi first came out, I had the opurtunity to use it and play around with it using Scratch and Python.
                                        <br> A few years later and I was using Python for my coursework for GCSE computer science for which I got an A.
                                        My experience didn't end here. I then managed to become an online tutor with MyTutor. I now have over 
                                        40 hours of experience on tutoring python to GCSE and A-Level students.

                                        <b><u>My Experience</u></b><br>
                                        I have plenty of experience with Microsoft Office. I have done many reports in Microsoft Word 
                                        ranging from 5 pages to 115. However, I have a lot more Experience in Excel as I
                                        have had to make reports on spending for others and myself from time to time. For my work experience,
                                        a large part of it was to organise a large amount of data into a spread sheet and make 
                                        it presentable.<br><br>
                                        The most experience I have is with Power Point. I have done countless presentations in and outside 
                                        of school. I really enjoy public speaking and this is one of my favourit ways of doing it. 
                                        My presintations tend to be very professional and clear which is definitely something that other people
                                        seem to struggle in.

                                        Like a lot of other people, I have a fair bit of experience in Photoshop and Premeire Pro as I too 
                                        wanted to start a YouTube channel. At first, I wanted to start a gaming channel. Therefore I have had a fair bit 
                                        of experience in editing screenshots for thumbnails and editing together videos to put up. After a while,
                                        I then tried starting a "Theory" channel. This is where I would research the science behind some movie or game
                                        scene and make a video about it. I had done one on the physics of Wonder Womans Lasso. This video took me over 
                                        two weeks to make and due to this experience, I soon stopped as it is a lot of work and it was very ambitious of 
                                        me to start this channel during A-Levels. Although I stopped, I still have a fair bit of experience of putting 
                                        together videos and editing pictures.

                                            <b><u>Why it is arguably my best quality</u></b><br>
                                            Growing up, I used to be a fairly shy child. This then drastically changed due to two reasons. The 
                                            first reason was due to the fact that I started to learn how to do and perform magic. But the second and 
                                            more important for this section is that I joined something called the ATC (Air Training Corps).
                                            <br>
                                            This is a youth military organisation which basically allows young people to do everything the Royal Air Force does.
                                            I acquired alot of skills during my service there and Leadership is definitely one of them. As you can probably imagine,
                                            this organisation really likes to push you out of your comfort zone.

                                            <b><u>Some Examples</u></b>

                                                <li>
                                                    One of the best examples of Leadership that I can think of occurred during a two week camp in Florida 
                                                    that I took part in. The worlds second largest airshow takes place there and we were given the task 
                                                    to marshal aircrafts. This is a perfect example as I we were required to work as a team and actively 
                                                    change between being team leaders and team players depending on the situation.

                                                <li>
                                                    Another set of events that jump out are the countless field craft exercises I took part in.
                                                    These are fairly complex activities which would involve trying to make and cross
                                                    a bridge with limited supplies or trying to guide a blind person through a maze. Being the team leader 
                                                    of one of these exercises is fairly hard as you have to be able to think on your toes and be able to 
                                                    work under pressure.

                                        teaching new recruits that joined our squadron. The things that I taught ranged from drills to how to improve uniform.
                                        This was just the start to my mentoring experience. After this, I was then chosen by my high school to teach year 11's 
                                        GCSE mathematics. This went pretty successfully and now I am an online tutor on a site called MyTutor and I have over 90 hours of 
                                        teaching there.

                                        been in many teams where I didn't particularly like the people I was with but I was able to put my feelings aside

                                        people in school to 500 in Florida. Admittedly, it is scary but the reward is far greater to me. I enjoy presenting and 
                                        I have been doing it for a while now so I feel like I am fairly good at it. I always took any opportunity I got whether 
                                        that be a small presentation in class to a close up magic session to a formal report that I would have to present.

                                        I have been in many teams and projects. In most of them, I naturally take the project manager/ leader role.
                                        I am able to work under pressure fairly well and this is probably why I get given this role or take it when given
                                        the option. I am able to make efficient plans before a task. During a task, I am also able to analyse the situation and adapt
                                        to the situation.

                                        This was a two week work experience I did when I was in year 10. I was given various tasks through out the two weeks, 
                                        but I was primarily working with the IT department. The first task that was given to me was to fo to all the different departments 
                                        and ask the staff their about their mail box permissions. I had to note down what permissions they had access to and 
                                        what permissions they needed in order to work. I then had to organise this data in a spreadsheet and present it to the IT staff later on.
                                        I had exceeded expectations and completed the task much sooner than the staff thought it would take. I was then tasked to set up some 
                                        new laptops that needed to be given out to employees. Along with this, I also had to setup some software on other PC's around the bulding.

                                        Recently, I have had the oppurtunity to work as an online tutor. I have had the opportunity to teach GCSE maths, Computer Science
                                        and A-Level Computer Science. This is a really valuable experience as I am communicating with young individuals and 
                                        I am, at times, trying to explain fairly complicated concepts. I believe that is is a really key skill to have and teaching 
                                        a subject makes you better at it. This also dosn't really feel like work as I enjoy helping people.

                                        In the summer holidays of this year, I also had a job at working at a local supermarket called Spar. This was a corner shop 
                                        and involved me communicating with customers a lot which is a really valuble experience to have. The job also required me to deal with 
                                        customer complaints and questions. Hence there was a lot of customer interaction. Other roles also included restocking the shelves and 
                                        keeping the place clean by moping.

                                                This is by far one of the best experiences I have had. This was part of a two week camp I took to Florida with the ATC.
                                                Sun 'N Fun is the world second biggest airshow and as cadets we were assigned various tasks around the air show to help out.
                                                My group was mostly at the short stay aeroplane parking area and our job was to marshall aircraft, that were comming in to see the 
                                                airshow, and tell them where to park as a team while having to deal with pedestrians and other fighter and stunt aircraft that were 
                                                coming in and taking off for the air show.
                                                 Other tasks included the same job but at different parking locations, selling tickets at

                                        We are unsure about how much money we raised as we were not allowed to count it, but we were able to easily fill up 8 to 9 containers, so a fair bit.

                                            Unlike other charities I raised money for, I got to see the results of raising this money as it went towards new sports equipment,

                                        For my first semester at university, I was tasked with making a game in Java. I had finished all the other required exercises 
                                        early so I had asked the professor if I can go all out with this game and he agreed as long as I can tick off every criteria point. 
                                        The reason that this game is text based is because we were first taught procedural programming rather that object orientated programming 
                                        straight away. Below there is a link to this java game that I created.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The game is heavily inspired by the PC game Jurassic World Evolution. This is a game where you genetically 
                                        make dinosaurs and create a park for tourists to visit. My take on the game is much simpler where you buy 
                                        dinosaurs and try to make a profit. Dinosaurs may break out and cause expenses that way. Furthermore, these dinosaurs 
                                        would eventually die, so they can’t make you money forever.

                                                Like the first project I did. This one was in my second semester where we were learning object orientated programming. 
                                                This now allowed me to make a graphical user interface which meant that I can make my game a lot more attractive. 
                                                Below you will see a slide show of screenshots of my game.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The game is fairly simple when it comes to the gameplay side of it. The objective is to get to the end of the level by 
                                                killing monsters in a Mario style platformer game. Your character earns experience depending on the level that you complete 
                                                and hence has more health and does more damage. You can also choose from a wide range of characters with different stats.

                                        In the second year of university, we had a module called "Software Engineering Project". For this, we where randomly put into groups of 5 or 6 and we got to choose a project to do from a listed selection.<br>
                                        In my group, I naturally took the leader position by delegating roles and assigning tasks to other members. Our end goal was to create a prototype for out application, the application was not supposed to be fully functional, however, my group was able to make a working prototype and put it on a server for others to use and test.<br> 
                                        The application has three different users who can do the following:<br>
                                        Teacher- Create Exam, Mark Exam<br>
                                        Marker - Mark Exam<br>
                                        Student - Take Exam, Register for Exam, View Previous Results.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        The idea was that teachers can create exams and set who would mark which questions. They can assign other Teachers or Markers who can mark them. Markers are people like demonstrators whos only purpose is to mark questions. Students can, therefore, register for exams, take exams, and view their results. (The system automatically marks any MC questions)

                                        This program can solve any word search. In order to do so, you need a txt file with the word search. Without any spaces and with one line
                                        right after the other. You then run the program with the txt file in the same location as the program. You then enter the name of the 
                                        file and (ie: "puzzle1.txt") and the program will then promt you to enter words to look for and return them in the wordsearch found.

                                        I wrote a program that is able to put almost any Matrix into echelon or reduced echelon form. I made this program to check over my work
                                        for my propability and matricies modual. the program shows every step of the process, hence it is easy to go through and check your work.
                                        <br>
                                        Problem- The major flaw with this program is that it dosnt work when the the answer will have fractions. This is due to doubles only being able to hold so much
                                        of a recuring decimal and hence not being able times properly.
